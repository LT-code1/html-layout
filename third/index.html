        Consider hiding the status bar -- and all other app UI -- while people are actively viewing full-screen media. If you hide the status bar, be sure to let people retrieve it ( and the appropriate app UI ) with a single tap. Unless you have a compelling reason to do so, avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or to remember it.
